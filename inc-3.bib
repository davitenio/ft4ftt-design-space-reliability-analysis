abstract = {Distributed embedded systems (DES) have been widely used in the last few decades in several application fields, ranging from industrial process control to avionics and automotive systems. In fact, it is expectable that this trend will continue over the years to come. In some of these application domains the dependability requirements are of utmost importance since failing to provide services in a timely and predictable manner may cause important economic losses or even put human life in risk. The adoption of the best practices in the design of distributed embedded systems does not fully avoid the occurrence of faults, arising from the non- deterministic behavior of the environment where each particular DES operates. Thus, fault-tolerance mechanisms need to be included in the DES to prevent possible faults leading to system failure. To be effective, fault-tolerance mechanisms require an a priori knowledge of the correct system behavior to be capable of distinguishing them from the erroneous ones. Traditionally, when designing fault-tolerance mechanisms, the a priori knowledge means that all possible operational modes are known at system design time and cannot adapt nor evolve during runtime. As a consequence, systems designed according to this principle are either fully static or allow a small number of operational modes only. Flexibility, however, is a desired property in a system in order to support evolving requirements, simplify maintenance and repair, and improve the efficiency in using system resources by using only the resources that are effectively required at each instant. This efficiency might impact positively on the system cost because with the same resources one can add more functionality or one can offer the same functionality with fewer resources. However, flexibility and dependability are often regarded as conflicting concepts. This is so because flexibility implies the ability to deal with evolving requirements that, in turn, can lead to unpredictable and possibly unsafe operating scenarios. Therefore, it is commonly accepted that only a fully static system can be made dependable, meaning that all operating conditions are completely defined at pre-runtime. In the broad sense and assuming unbounded flexibility this assessment is true, but if one restricts and controls the ways the system could adapt to evolving requirements, then it might be possible to enforce continuous dependability. This thesis claims that it is possible to provide a bounded degree of flexibility without compromising dependability and proposes some mechanisms to build safety-critical systems based on the Controller Area Network (CAN). In particular, the main focus of this work is the Flexible Time-Triggered CAN protocol (FTT-CAN), which was specifically developed to provide such high level of operational flexibility, not only combining the advantages of time- and event-triggered paradigms but also providing flexibility to the time-triggered traffic. This fact makes the development of fault-tolerant mechanisms more complex in FTT-CAN than in other protocols, such as TTCAN or FlexRay, in which there is a priori static common knowledge of the time-triggered message schedule shared by all nodes. Nevertheless, as it is demonstrated in this work, it is possible to build fault-tolerant mechanisms for FTT-CAN that preserve its high level of operational flexibility, particularly concerning the time-triggered traffic. With such mechanisms it is argued that FTT-CAN is suitable for safety- critical applications, too. This claim was validated in the scope of the FTT-CAN protocol by presenting a fault-tolerant system architecture with replicated masters and fail-silent nodes. The specific problems and mechanisms related with master replication, particularly a protocol to enforce consistency during updates of replicated data structures and another protocol to transfer these data structures to an unsynchronized node upon asynchronous startup or restart, are also addressed. Moreover, this thesis also discusses the implementations of fail-silence in FTT- CAN nodes and proposes two solutions, both based on hardware components that are attached to the node network interface. One solution relies on bus guardians that allow enforcing fail-silence in the time domain. These bus guardians are adapted to support dynamic traffic scheduling and are fit for use in FTT-CAN slave nodes, only. The other solution relies on a special network interface, with duplicated microprocessor interface, that supports internal replication of the node, transparently. In this case, fail-silence can be assured both in the time and value domain since transmissions are carried out only if both internal nodes agree on the transmission instant and message contents. This solution is well adapted for use in the masters but it can also be used, if desired, in slave nodes.},

abstract = {Distributed embedded systems (DES) have been widely used in the last few decades in several application domains, from robotics, industrial process control, avionics and automotive. In fact, it is expectable that this trend will continue in the next years. In some of these application fields the dependability requirements are very important since the fail to provide services in a timely and predictable manner may cause important economic losses or even put humans in risk. In the design phase it is impossible to predict all the possible scenarios of faults, due to the non deterministic behaviour of the surrounding environment. In that way, the fault tolerance mechanisms must be included in the distributed embedded system to prevent failures occurrence. Also, many application domains require a high available bandwidth to perform the desired functions, or to turn possible the scaling with the addition of new features. The flexibility of a system also plays an important role, since it improves the capability to adapt to the surrounding world, and to the simplicity of the repair and maintenance. The flexibility improves the efficiency of all the system by providing a way to efficiently manage the available resources. This is very important in embedded systems due to the limited resources often available. A natural way to improve the bandwidth and the fault tolerance in distributed systems is to use replicated buses. Commercial and academic solutions propose the use of replicated fieldbuses for a single purpose only, either to improve the fault tolerance or to improve the available bandwidth, being the first the most common. One illustrative exception is FlexRay where the bus replica can be used to improve the bandwidth of the overall system, besides enabling redundant communications. However, only one bus replica can be used. In this thesis, a flexible bus replication scheme to improve both the dependability and the throughput of fieldbuses is presented and studied. It can be applied to any number of replicated buses, provided the required hardware support is available. The flexible use of the replicated buses can achieve an also flexible management of the network topology. This claim has been validated using the Controller Area Network (CAN) fieldbus, which has been chosen because it is widely spread in millions of systems. In fact, the proposed solution uses a paradigm that combines flexibility, time and event triggered communication, that is the Flexible Time- Triggered over CAN network (FTT-CAN). However, a generalization to native CAN is also presented and studied. The inclusion of bus replication in FTT-CAN imposes not only new mechanisms but also changes of the mechanisms associated with the master replication, which has been already studied in previous research work. In this work, these mechanisms were combined and take advantage of the centralized architecture and of the redundant masters to support an efficient and flexible bus replication. When considering the system operation, if a fault in the bus (or buses) occurs, and the consequent error leads to a system failure, the system reacts, switching to a degraded mode, where the message flows that were transmitted in the faulty bus (or buses) change to the non-faulty ones. The central node replication uses a leader-follower strategy, where the leader controls the system while the followers serve as backups. If an error occurs in the leader, a backup will take the system control maintaining the system with the same functionalities. The system has been generalized for native CAN, using two additional components that provide the same fault tolerance capabilities at the bus level, and also enable the dynamic management of the network topology. All the referred proposals were implemented and assessed in the scope of this work. The single bus version of FTT-CAN was assessed using a real application, a robotic soccer team, which has obtained excellent results in international competitions. There, the FTT-CAN based embedded system has been applied in the low level control, where, mainly it is responsible for the motion control and odometry. For the case of the multiple buses system, the assessment was performed in a laboratory test bed. For this, a fault injector was developed in order to impose faults in the buses and in the central nodes. To measure the time reaction of the system, a special hardware has been developed: a delay measurement system. It is able to measure delays between two important time marks for posterior offline analysis of the obtained values.},

abstract = {Transient communication faults in distributed control systems (DCS) are unavoidable but must be handled adequately in order to enforce correct system behaviour. A typical way of handling transient faults is temporal redundancy by means of retransmissions. However, DCS are frequently designed with time-triggered architectures, being scheduled offline and not coping efficiently with retransmissions as these require the pre-allocation of bandwidth that, in the absence of errors, is wasted. In this paper we propose using the Flexible Time-Triggered paradigm to reconcile the Time-Triggered model with on-line scheduling of retransmissions when needed, only, leading to an efficient bandwidth usage. This is confirmed with preliminary experimental results obtained on an FTT-CAN network.},
